			<p>
				This plugin is to assist with building ads to deploy on Apple News.
				This means that they must resize to the size associated with the Apple device and orientation defined by the Apple News HTML spec (link here).				
				There are two main Apple News sizes: the Double Banner and the Large Banner.
				For both, you would choose two sizes to designate as either the Landscape or Portrait creative.
				Then the Apple News will use the creative appropriate for the phone's orientation.
